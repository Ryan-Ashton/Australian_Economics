    "The original, seasonally adjusted and trend estimates are three separate series describing different aspects of the same data. These series are useful for different purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ORIGINAL ESTIMATES\n",
    "\n",
    "The original is the best estimate we can make of the level of activity at any particular point in time. These are the estimates you’d use when focusing on history - e.g. auditing, comparing different data sources, assessing market share. Note that different months are not directly comparable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SEASONALLY ADJUSTED ESTIMATES\n",
    "\n",
    "Seasonally adjusted estimates are produced by removing seasonal patterns from the original estimates. They are good for performance measures and comparisons - was that advertising campaign effective, how much tourist traffic did we lose because of the Tsunami, is unemployment doing better in QLD than in TAS. Again, they’re very history focused. Different months are comparable but month-to-month movements are usually dominated by irregular effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TREND ESTIMATES - Using\n",
    "\n",
    "Trend estimates are produced by smoothing noise from the seasonally adjusted estimates. This is the best source of information for forecasting or making decisions about what to do in the future. It is directly comparable at different points in time. Trend estimates are revised as new original estimates become available. This makes sure we have the most up-to-date and best possible estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some questions you need to consider more than one series. Few retailers would hire many staff in late December, because sales consistently drop in January - something you can see from the seasonal pattern, the original minus the seasonally adjusted."
